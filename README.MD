# CF-Hit-Counter
![](./logo2.jpeg)
A serverless implementation of the classic hit-counter widget on old, shitty geocities' sites. Uses a custom font to render an svg image in the "cloud", simultaneously counting the hit that accessing that font represents -- The idea being one-click embeddable images.
